# 2018 Shopify UX Challenge Solution

## About Me
My name is Yong Lin Wang, I am a software engineering student at University of Ottawa. Althrough I am not applying to Shopify for the spring-winter term, I decided to challenge myself and build some front-end development skills by taking on their UX programming challenge. If you like what I made and it helped you with your project, why not star this repository? :^)

## About the Solution
Just like everybody else, I hopped on the ReactJS bandwaggon earlier this year. So I decided to complete this project using ReactJS library instead of vanilla Javascript. For the icons, I chose fontawesome as it has one of the simpler implementations. The animations are powered by a ReactJS add-on called ReactCSSTransitionGroup
